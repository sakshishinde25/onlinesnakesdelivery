 Over the course of four decades, a lot has changed about us. We have relocated, undergone expansion, developed new product lines & added many segments.
One thing hasn’t changed - we’re still a tight-knit family business, committed to serving the most authentic taste of India through our products.
Our origins can be traced back to a small namkeen shop in koregaon founded by Aditya Madhukar Pawar. This modest shop quickly gained popularity and scaled up to meet a booming demand for its unique-tasting bhujia.
